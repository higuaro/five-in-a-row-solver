A solver for the game "Five in a row" (a some sort of variation of the tic tac toe game with a bigger board), the game is featured as one of the puzzles in the 'point and click' adventure game [Machinarium](http://machinarium.net/) 

The following is an image of the puzzle board in action:

It's a mini game played against the computer, who take turns marking the spaces with up-side-down screws in a 10Ã—10 grid. To win you need to place five bolt heads in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

The idea for this repo is to hold a general solver for the mini game, so it can be used to for future similar games/puzzles.
